    <p>I’m that annoying guy who likes to start talking to you on a train or something. Uhh. Yeah. </p>

  <p>The biggest reason I’m doing this is because it’s both fun and it feels that the you reach your destination way faster than when you’re actually just waiting and scrolling through your phone.

  I’m also a software engineer and I love how people design and share their own experiences. </p>
