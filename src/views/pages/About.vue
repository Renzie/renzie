      <p>I’m that annoying guy who likes to start talking to you on a train or something. Uhh. Yeah. </p>

    <p>The biggest reason I’m doing this is because it’s both fun and it feels that the you reach your destination way faster than when you’re actually just waiting and scrolling through your phone.

    I’m also a software engineer and I love how people design and share their own experiences. </p>

Now, there are so many other different interests that I would like to share with you people. Maybe using a couple of lists might be the easiest way to show you:

Experiences in technologies
HTML, CSS

Javascript

Vue (learning)

Angular (it’s been a while)

React (learning)

Java

Apache Beam

Scala (been a while)

Interests
Piano (Hobby)

Storytelling

Personal Development

Design (in life and projects)

I could write a blog later on to cover up the storytelling.
To go in detail about personal development, I could list some things I’m currently working on in my life:

Meditation

Journaling

Trying to clean my appartment regularly

Taking more and more walks

Running
